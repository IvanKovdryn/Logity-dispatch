                Being a truck driver in the USA is not a job, but a lifestyle.
                And today, truck drivers are an integral part of American roads.
                This activity requires unique qualities from a person, in
                addition to physical strength and health-endurance, the ability
                to make decisions in emergencies, and responsibility. A
                trucker&#8217;s professional training begins at a driving
                school, where he gets a driver&#8217;s license and the right to
                drive large vehicles.&nbsp;

                However, is everything simple and only a particular category of
                rights enough to work in commercial cargo transportation? To
                work in logistics, the driver must obtain a list of documents
                allowing such activities to be carried out. One such document is
                the SCAC code.&nbsp;
              </p>

              <p>
                A standard code usually consists of 2-4 letters and identifies
                vehicles. This system appeared in the 60s of the 20th century to
                identify drivers and transport goods.

              <h2 id="what-is-a-scac-code">What is a SCAC code?</h2>

              <p>
                This code is used to identify US carriers or shipping companies.
                Usually consists of a number up to 4 digits. It allows you to
                register cargo in a system, eliminating bureaucracy and
                transferring documents from the carrier to the customer. Also,
                it makes it easier to track the driver, and the cargo carried.
                With the SCAC code, you can track the movement of goods. As a
                result, your bills of lading, packing lists, and purchase orders
                are digitized for easy access.
              </p>

              <p>
                Drivers work in rather difficult conditions, driving 8-10 hours
                a day, often forced to spend the night in roadside motels or, in
                the absence of such, directly in a specially equipped car cabin.
                They think about their route, follow the rules, fighting fatigue
                from the monotonous landscapes in front of their eyes, so such
                automated systems can make your life very easy.
              </p>

              <p>
                The code has become a mandatory part of logistics in the US. It
                is used by all companies involved in land, air, rail, and sea
                transportation. Both commercial and government companies use
                this.
              </p>

              <p>
                The SCAC code is used both in international and domestic
                shipments. It gives access to all information about the
                transported goods and allows you to control the legality of
                businesses.
              </p>

              <p>
                The transported cargo can be building materials, furniture,
                decor, fertilizers, livestock, equipment, textiles,
                correspondence, etc. Bulk products are transported in dump
                trucks or containers. Permits are required for some types of
                cargo (chemicals, medicines, fertilizers).

                Why do I need a SCAC code for trucking?
              </h3>

              <p>
                We can say that the code is required for all carriers operating
                in the United States, especially those cooperating with
                government agencies.

              <p>
                This step you make only after you have already got your CDL. In
                some states, you can take the exam up to three times. In others,
                it is allowed to take several times. How much does it cost to
                complete all the stages to drive a truck? If you want to study
                at Truck Driving School, your expenses can range from 2000 to
                5000 USD.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then you can get your SCAC code through the NMFTA. All you have
                to do is apply online or contact them by phone at (703)
                838-1831, pay the $84 service fee and wait for a response to
                your email.

                When the application is processed, you will be able to receive
                the code by email within 24 hours. If there is a delay,
                don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us to ensure that your

              <p>
                A computer system that gives access to all documents between the
                contractor and the customer, including the movement of cargo and
                complete information about it, is called EDI. Its advantage for
                freight brokers is that all data is provided in one language and
                does not require fussing with paperwork. This dramatically saves
                time using mail or faxes and telephone conversations and
                significantly increases profit. Everything you need you can get
                online. What types of documents can be used in EDI? Invoices,
                payments, customs papers, updates, notices, and more.
              </p>

              </h2>

              <p>
                So, using EDI technologies guarantees fast and efficient
                cooperation between you and your business partners. Improving
                the quality of communication increases efficiency and allows you
                to control all processes. This is a significant and now integral
                part of the shipping process. And we will help you succeed in
                the logistics business and take your company to the next level.
