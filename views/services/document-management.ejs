              range of solutions for truckers and trucking companies, including
              dispatch services dedicated to providing you invaluable support –
              especially with things the industry requires but that take you
              away from core business activities. For many clients, our trucking

            <h2>Management of Trucking Documents</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              When the general public thinks of what truckers do, they often
              omit all the administrative duties from the picture. As the world
              moves into digitalization, there are other considerations, too,
              such as data and information security. Making sure you have all
              your mandatory documentation and that it is properly completed,
              filed, and kept takes up a good chunk of time and effort. This can
              be stressful in and of itself, but it can also add undue stress to
              operating your trucking enterprise. That’s where Logity Dispatch
              comes in.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Comprehensive Coverage</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              There is so much more to trucking than driving. Sadly, we know
              that in reality, there are stringent requirements for paperwork,
              compliance with SAFETY/DOT and other regulations, and insurance –
              not to mention finding, negotiating, and booking loads. That’s why
              we cover everything – broker/carrier packages and set-up
              paperwork, W-9, proof of insurance and insurance certificates,
              rate confirmations, invoicing, waybills, bills of lading, and
              customs/transportation documents. We also handle requirements set
              out in customer agreements – directions to shipper or consignee
              and appointment scheduling.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Expertise and Excellence</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              At Logity Dispatch, we pride ourselves on our commitment to client
              care. Part of this is knowing the ins and outs of the trucking
              industry, which includes industry standards and regulatory
              requirements. We understand what is required, as well as why it’s
              required and who needs to see it. When we prepare, file, and
              manage trucking documentation, we are diligent, accurate, and
              ensure that everything that needs to be in the paperwork is there.
              We take your success very seriously – because your success is our
              success, too.

            <h2>Our Approach to Document Management</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Logity Dispatch provides best-in-class management of trucking
              documentation by itself or as part of a more comprehensive
              dispatch service package. That’s because we know that different
              trucking businesses need different levels of support. Part of our
              no-nonsense approach to service is working with our clients to
              provide exactly what they need. We know you know your business
              better, and we aren’t here to sell you anything you don’t want.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>But More Than Just Document Management</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Of course, many of our clients value our full array of services
              because putting everything they don’t want to deal with into our
              capable hands frees them up to focus on what they do best. Through
              our dispatch service, we search for loads, negotiate rates – the
              highest price we can get for our clients so they make more money –
              and coordinate the details. We do the billing, management trucking
              paperwork and make sure everything that needs to be done for the
              customer contracts is done, properly and on time. We are also
              happy to assist clients by doing their bookkeeping and accounting,
              setting up and maintaining their IFTA reports, working with online
              transportation management services, and more.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Logity?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              With our years of industry expertise and our dedicated, devoted,
              professional personnel, Logity exists for one reason: to provide
              truckers and trucking businesses a reason to trust dispatch
              partners again. For us, good service, honesty, and transparency
              are paramount. Clients love our ability to search numerous
              platforms, take the time to find the best loads for their size,
              structure, and objectives – and benefit from our acumen in
              negotiations. Many are surprised at what a cost-effective and
              profitable option we are, compared to hiring a full-time in-house
              dispatcher – saving time and money on things like office rental
              and recruiting. We refuse to waste your time by embellishing
              reality – about costs, expectations, or anything else. We promise
              what we deliver, and deliver what we promise.
