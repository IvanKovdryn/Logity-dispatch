            <h2>Safety Compliance</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              For many business owners, maintaining compliance with regulations
              and industry directives is a tedious pain in the back end. No one
              likes paperwork, and it can be hard to keep up with all the
              changes. Worst of all, mistakes or omissions can result in costly
              penalties. Thankfully, Logity Dispatch has your solution.

            <h2>FMCSA/DoT Requirements and Beyond</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Navigating all the rules and regulations under the Department of
              Transportation and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations can be
              time-consuming. There is a lot of documentation and monitoring
              required, even if it’s just for a 1-ton truck. Here are some
              requirements you need to know.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Driver Qualification</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Unsurprisingly, if you are going to employ drivers to carry
              interstate and intrastate loads, they require driver qualification
              files, which include information such as driving history,
              employment history, road test certificate, certificate of
              violations, and a three-year inquiry to state agencies. That’s in
              addition to meeting the general driving credentials. Driver
              qualification logs must be updated annually. DoT also requires
              drug and alcohol testing in certain circumstances.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>
              Truck ELD Requirements for Drivers Logs/ELogs for Truck Drivers
            </h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              As of December 2019, the FMCSA truck ELD requirements took effect.
              Carriers must monitor compliance with the daily Hours of Service
              mandate using an ELD (electronic logging device that creates
              electronic logs for truck drivers) connected to the truck engine.
              You also need to conduct monthly recaps of drivers logs and
              reports in order to take corrective action if there is
              non-compliant behavior. The elogs for truck drivers are an easy
              target for DoT inspectors and auditors, so it is imperative to
              ensure that you get this right.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Other Requirements</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Of course, the DoT/FMCSA also allows roadside safety and state
              mileage audits and inspections. Additionally, you can have IRP and
              IFTA audits. That’s a lot to be on top of — so why not let Logity
              Dispatch worry about that?

            <h2>Choosing a DOT Compliance Service</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              There is very little room to maneuver when it comes to compliance.
              The trucking industry is regulated carefully and precisely, and
              this is done for good reason — to protect the rights of drivers
              and of clients and to ensure the safety of everyone on the road.
              This makes staying compliant critical for all drivers and
              owner-operators. It also means that there is no margin for error.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              With this in mind, it makes sense to choose a DOT compliance
              service that can help you secure compliance without the hassle. As
              a truck driver, you already have a lot on your mind when it comes
              to running your business and providing your services to your
              clients in the right way. Letting a trusted partner take care of
              your compliance can make the other aspects of operation much
              easier.
            </p>

              Take a look at some of the benefits of working with a trusted DOT
              compliance partner.

            <h3>
              Peace of mind when handling electronic logs for truck drivers
            </h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Drivers logs now need to be fully digitized. This means, your
              drivers’ daily logs and all other regular logging and reporting
              need to be handled by a truck ELD. This makes life easier for
              truck drivers, but it also adds an element of anxiety. These
              electronic drivers logs need to be properly managed and
              maintained, and failing to do this can result in non-compliance
              and a hefty fine.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The right service provider will manage these elogs for truck
              drivers so you don’t have to worry about it. This way, you can
              appreciate the benefits of electronic logs for drivers without
              experiencing any of the hassles and difficulties that can come
              with this.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Protect your business’s revenue</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              ELD truck requirements and other compliance regulations are
              enforced by government agencies and authorities. This means you
              could be facing a fine if you are found to be operating outside
              the compliance rules and regulations. Making sure your truck elogs
              are up to date, and ensuring that your business adheres fully to
              all safety regulations, helps you avoid any such penalties.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              But, in fact, the right service can achieve even more for you and
              your business. Regulatory compliance is something that your
              clients really care about. They want to know that you are
              following drivers logs rules, maintaining public safety, and doing
              everything you can to be a responsible and reliable driver and
              owner-operator. When you are compliant with regulation, you are
              providing this to your customers, and a compliance service helps
              you ensure this.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Grow your business with confidence</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              You are focused on achieving great results for your clients right
              here and right now, but you are also thinking about the future.
              You need to be able to grow your business and expand what you
              provide to your customers, and you need to be able to do all of
              this with confidence.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Perhaps you want to add larger vehicles to your business fleet —
              and get an ELD for one ton truck, for example. Or, you simply want
              to make sure that all of your commercial vehicles and trucks are
              on the ELD system. Maybe you want to ensure that all of your
              vehicles and your operations are fully compliant with safety
              regulation, even at scale. The right service provider will be able
              to achieve this for you.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Focus on running your business in the right way</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              You love to drive, and you love to serve your clients wherever
              they are found. You might not love logging your driver activity or
              meticulously checking each and every aspect of compliance
              regulation to make sure you are in adherence.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This is why DOT compliance services are so useful to truck drivers
              and owner-operators. With these services, drivers can focus on
              doing what they do best — driving and going above and beyond
              client expectations.
