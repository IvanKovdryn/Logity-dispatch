            <h2>Trucking Document Dispatch Services</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Document dispatch services understand that hauling products from
              point A to point B is not the end of the day for truck drivers.
              Truck drivers are faced with hours of administrative paperwork
              long after their route is complete. Stringent requirements for
              paperwork must be met to stay in compliance with safety and U.S.
              Department of Transportation regulations. Insurance documents, log
              sheets, trip sheets, bills of lading, and accident/incident
              reports are just the tip of the paperwork iceberg. With all this
              paperwork facing them, truck drivers can feel overwhelmed.
              Document dispatch services can help.

            <h2>Documents service dispatch: mandatory paperwork</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Commercial truck drivers need to know more than how to operate
              their rig and follow state and federal safety guidelines.
              Completing paperwork is a significant part of the job. Failure to
              complete and file all your mandatory documentation can cause
              problems. For instance, receipts for all expenses during a trip
              must be attached to trip sheets. Whether you work for a carrier
              that will reimburse you directly for the expenses or you file them
              on your annual tax return, you must have documentation that meets
              the conditions of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Our
              documents service dispatch can help.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Here is a breakdown of some of the other required documents for
              which truck drivers are responsible:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                <span class="bold-font">Customs paperwork.</span> This is
                necessary for truckers with routes that cross the border from
                the U.S. into Canada or Mexico.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                <span class="bold-font">Trip sheets.</span> Every company has
                them, and they must be completed accurately if you want to get
                paid.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                <span class="bold-font">Accident/incident reports.</span>
                Whether you have damaged freight or were involved in a crash,
                most carriers require a detailed report for their records and to
                ensure compliance with DOT regulations.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h2>Mandated DOT documentation</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Every truck driver carries a document folder in their rig.
              Inspections can go south in a hurry when truck drivers are missing
              required DOT documentation. As part of our documents service
              dispatch, we ensure truck drivers are never caught unprepared.
              Here is what we help you keep updated:

                make/model. Information on the rig’s registered owner also is
                required.

            <h2>How document service dispatch works</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              It is called mandatory documentation for a reason. Failure to
              comply means truck drivers may not get paid for their time. In
              some scenarios – like accidents – improperly completing the
              required paperwork can cost truck drivers their commercial
              drivers’ licenses.
