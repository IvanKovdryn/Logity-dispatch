            <h2>Better options of Factoring Services for Trucking Companies</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              It’s challenging enough to operate a business — especially a small
              one or if you’re just starting out — and maintaining a reliable,
              steady cash flow can mean the difference between sinking or
              swimming. Unpaid invoices throw a huge wrench into the works,
              especially if you depend on the incoming funds for payroll or
              rent.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s why Logity Dispatch has teamed up with professional
              factoring companies to provide our clients with factoring services
              that can make all the difference in the way they do business.

            <h2>What is freight factoring?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Truck factoring service — also known as freight factoring — allows
              carriers and owner-operators to turn unpaid invoices into cash.
              Essentially, a third-party freight factoring company for trucking
              will effectively buy those outstanding accounts receivable at an
              advance rate of usually 80% to 90% of the value and then collect
              on those unpaid invoices themselves.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Why You Should Consider a Truck Factoring Service</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Factoring in the trucking industry means someone else takes the
              risk of non-payment. For many trucking companies, even getting a
              discounted amount for invoices is well worth getting a freight
              factoring specialist for trucking companies since they have
              immediate funds with which they can pay overhead costs or even
              take on additional work to make more money.

            <h2>The Benefits of Factoring for Trucking Companies</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              We’ve touched on a few of the benefits of factoring for a trucking
              company, but let’s break these down in more detail. It’s not
              unusual for drivers to feel a little reluctant to part with a
              portion of their profits, and this is a necessary fact of working
              with a factoring service for the trucking industry. However, the
              small amount of lost profit can actually lead to serious
              advantages for businesses and drivers and can even see you
              increasing your profits over the long term.
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                Swift capital upfront
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              There can often be a lag between taking on a job and then getting
              paid for it. While this is not always a problem — for example,
              while business is good and while company revenue is high — it can
              cause serious disadvantages for drivers in leaner times. It’s also
              not fair, as the truck driver has held up their end of the deal
              and has still not been paid.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              With factoring, there is no such concern. Money is paid upfront by
              the third-party freight factoring or trucking factoring company,
              and the truck driver receives their capital up swiftly and without
              delay.
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                A more reliable source of revenue
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              Forecasting and projecting for the future can be difficult for
              truck drivers. Even when orders are coming in, it is likely that
              many of the payments on these orders will be delayed, meaning that
              drivers cannot predict precisely when they will receive the money
              that is owed to them. This is a major issue, particularly when it
              comes to securing loans or investment for business growth
              projects. To put it simply, a lack of reliability makes it hard
              for truck drivers and owner-operators to grow their business in
              the way they’d like.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              With a truck factoring service, this uncertainty is removed. When
              taking on factored orders and jobs, drivers are securing a
              reliable stream of income. They can then use this reliable income
              stream to prove their annual revenue, which makes it easier to
              attract investors, qualify for loans, and expand the scope and
              capability of the business.
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                Better flexibility solutions in terms of income
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              Some drivers may not like the idea of accepting a factored order.
              After all, when accepting this kind of order, the driver can only
              expect to receive around 80% or 90% of the total cost of the
              order, which may seem unfair as it is the driver who is doing the
              actual driving. However, the idea of factoring services for a
              trucking company or driver is that they accept this discounted
              rate so that they can connect with a more reliable payment.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This gives you flexibility as a truck driver or owner-operator.
              You can accept factored orders that provide you with a baseline of
              income — a regular stream of revenue that you can put your faith
              in. Then, you can enhance this revenue by taking on other orders
              at full payment. As your situation changes and you become more or
              less risk-averse, you may decide to shift the ratio one way or
              another — the choice is yours, thanks to this increased
              flexibility.
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                Reduced risk as a better service
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              An unreliable payment schedule is one thing, but the risk of not
              getting paid at all is an even more serious concern for truck
              drivers. Disputes with clients, unscrupulous customers, and a
              whole host of other factors can contribute to the risk of
              non-payment. For small trucking businesses or for truck driver
              owner-operators, this can be catastrophic. Too many businesses
              have run into serious trouble because they cannot secure the
              payments they are entitled to.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This is obviously a major benefit for truck drivers. With a truck
              factoring service, the risk of non-payment is taken on by someone
              else. You do not need to worry about receiving the money due to
              you, and you can focus on other — more positive — aspects of
              running your business.
            </p>

            <h2>How Trucking Factoring Works</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              The general process you encounter with trucking factoring is as
              follows:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                You invoice your client for work done.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                You assign unpaid invoices to a truck factoring service. If you
                are doing contract factoring (high volume), you are assigning
                all your unpaid invoices to the trucking factoring company. If
                you are going by way of spot factoring for trucking (low
                volume), you decide which invoices you will assign for truck
                factoring services.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                The truck factoring company pays you the agreed-upon advance.
                Once everything is set up, this can be as soon as within 24
                hours.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                Your client pays the truck factoring service — it is now the
                responsibility of the factoring company to chase down clients
                for payment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                Once the invoice is paid, the factoring company will take its
                fee cut and then send you the balance.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="expect-col">
            <img src="/img/facService/img2.jpg" alt="img" />
          </div>
          <div class="expect-text">
            <h2>Which is best for you: recourse or non-recourse factoring?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Your agreement for truck factoring services can be a recourse
              agreement or a non-recourse agreement.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If you have a recourse agreement and your customers do NOT pay
              their invoices, you are required to buy them back. The trucking
              factoring company may even charge additional fees.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If you have a non-recourse agreement, once the factoring company
              is assigned the unpaid invoices, they belong to the factoring
              company. If the clients don’t pay, it is no longer your problem.
              As a consequence, the rates charged by factoring companies tend to
              be higher for non-recourse agreements.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Factoring for Trucking: Pros and Cons</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              As with any important business decision, whether you decide to use
              a truck factoring service depends on your business model, scale of
              operations, and how much risk you want to assume.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Types of freight companies who factor</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Your agreement for truck factoring services can be a recourse
              agreement or a non-recourse agreement. Some of the pros of truck
              factoring include:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                Few qualification requirements – This type of invoice factoring
                revolves around how creditworthy your clients are, so you won’t
                have many qualification requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                Almost immediate funding – Instead of waiting for the invoice
                due date to come and go before receiving the monies owing to
                you, you can get most of the sum upfront through the factoring
                company.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                The more your business grows, the more financing you can get –
                This is because the value of the invoices you assign determines
                the amount of your advance. So, as you get more established,
                your advances can become larger.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              Some of the cons of hiring a trucking factoring company include:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                It can be expensive – In exchange for getting funds in advance
                through the trucking factoring service, you lose a portion of
                the sum owed to you (that is, the factoring company’s discount
                rate).
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                It can end up costing more if your client doesn’t pay the
                invoice – If you have a recourse factoring agreement, you are
                obligated to buy back the invoice if the customer doesn’t pay,
                and you will likely have to pay a fee to the factoring company.
              </li>
            </ul>

              For many trucking companies, the ability to retain factoring
              services helps keep them in business and maintain a healthy cash
