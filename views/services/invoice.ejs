            <br />
            <p>
              Your trucking services offer great advantages to your clients.
              They have specific needs related to the transportation and
              delivery of goods, and you have the skills and equipment required
              to fulfill those needs. But you need to be supported too – you
              need the steady stream of revenue that keeps you on the road and
              your business growing.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This is where trucking invoices are so important. You complete
              your service, bill your customer, and receive your payment. It
              should be as simple as that.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              But, invoices for trucking companies are a little more complex
              than this. Here at Logity Dispatch, our invoicing services are
              designed to keep you and your business moving forward while
              keeping your clients happy at the same time.

            <h2>Logity Dispatch Invoicing Services for Trucking Companies</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Logity Dispatch’s services are designed with trucking companies in
              mind. We understand how important it is to receive prompt and
              reliable payment for the services you provide, as this is what
              keeps your company going. We also recognize how vital it is to
              have strong relationships with your clients, so we deliver our
              services with this in mind too. These services include the
              following key aspects:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                Reliable Billing
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              Logity Dispatch handles invoicing for you, offering reliable bills
              to your trucking clients to ensure all your work is properly
              accounted for. This forms the basis of your revenue stream and
              helps you achieve the funds you need to grow your business. With a
              solid invoicing strategy and a good stream of revenue, you will
              find it much easier to plan for future growth.
            </p>

                Ongoing Management
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              Unfortunately, bills are not always paid on time. Invoice
              management services help you follow up on unpaid bills and
              invoices, taking the stress out of management. This also helps you
              recoup money owed for trucking services sooner rather than later
              while maintaining a positive relationship with clients.
            </p>

            <p>
              Different clients will have different requirements when it comes
              to invoicing. For your more long-term clients, you may need to
              break out of your regular trucking company invoice schedule and
              provide something a little more flexible. This can be difficult to
              achieve when you are concentrating on driving and logistics, which
              is why Logity Dispatch handles this for you. Foster strong
              connections between your business and your clients without the
              additional hassle.

                Tax Planning for Your Business

            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              Going it alone as a truck driver or trucking company
              owner-operator means bearing the tax burden that comes with this.
              Invoicing is a big part of this, and it is this that will form the
              basis of your tax strategy. However, you didn’t get into truck
              driving because of your love of tax planning and invoicing. So,
              let the expert team at Logity Dispatch handle all of this for you.

            <br />
            <p>
              We listen to our trucking customers, and we work to research and
              discover which solutions work best for them. We then use this
              insight to craft invoicing services that are perfectly suited to
              truck drivers and owner-operators in the field. The result is a
              set of tried-and-tested services that go above and beyond the
              needs of our customers.

            <p>
              We don’t just provide these tried-and-tested trucking services on
              an off-the-peg basis. We also take the time to get to know you,
              your clients, and the specific approaches you need to achieve
              success. This helps us to be flexible in the solutions we offer.

            <p>
              Everything we provide to drivers is intended to make life and work
              easier and more effective. Chasing up unpaid bills and handling a
              flexible invoicing strategy detract from the services you provide
              to your trucking clients. This is why we work hard to take the
              stress out of running your business.
