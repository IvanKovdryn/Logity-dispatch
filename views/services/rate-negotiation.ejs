            <h2>What to expect from our truck rate negotiation services</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              More and more truck drivers across the US are turning to Logity
              Dispatch for rate negotiation and more. Here’s why.
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                A fair rate for you and your clients
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              You provide a great service for your clients, and so you deserve
              to get paid a fair truck rate per mile and per load. You also work
              to support your clients’ needs, and so you want to offer a
              competitive rate that keeps your business moving and your
              customers smiling. We understand this, which is why we apply our
              expert negotiation skills to get you the best truck driver pay
              rate for your services.

            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              We can search for loads nationwide, which means that you only need
              to worry about driving while we handle the rest. This translates
              to a solid revenue stream for your business. You can scale and
              grow your operation, connecting with the opportunities you need
              and building lasting relationships with all-important clients.

            <p>
              Many factors go into crafting the ideal relationship between
              truckers and clients. There is the pricing, but there are also
              other terms and conditions that must be discussed and agreed upon.
              This is where our negotiation expertise comes into play, and it
              goes way beyond simply organizing a pay rate for truck drivers.
              You will enjoy opportunities and terms that suit you while also
              helping your clients achieve their objectives.

              You take care of the driving; we take care of the rest. We apply
              this motto to all of our services, including our rate negotiation

            <br />
            <p>
              We don’t believe in ‘off the peg’ services or a ‘one size fits
              all’ approach. We know that the truckers we work with each have
              specific needs and expectations, which is why we work closely with
              you to get to know what you and your operation are all about. We
              can then provide a tailored service that helps you go above and

            <h2>Why Freight Rate Negotiations Are So Important</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              What is it that makes freight rate negotiations so important? Why
              do you need to connect with the best rate negotiation services in
              the industry? There are a number of factors to consider here.
              Let’s take a look at some of the most critical for you and your
              business.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Secure a fair truck rate for drivers</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Truck drivers are the backbone of the United States. The services
              you provide help keep this country moving and businesses thriving,
              and help ensure that the domestic economy stays strong. This means
              you deserve a fair truck driver pay rate.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Whether you operate on an average rate per mile basis or you
              prefer to run your truck driver business according to an hourly
              rate, that pay rate needs to support you as a business owner and
              as an individual. Truck drivers like you have a difficult and
              taxing job to do, and your goals include achieving great results
              for clients. Freight rate negotiations make sure that this is the
              case.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Support safety and security in the industry</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              The trucking industry is regulated for a reason. Truck drivers
              have a right to feel safe and secure when they are out on the
              road. Clients have the right to feel that their logistics drivers
              and couriers are providing a reliable service. Other road users
              have the right to drive without the fear of encountering risks and
              hazards along the way.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>
              Stay competitive in your field with the right truck driver pay
              rate
            </h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Logistics is a competitive field. There are a great many different
              drivers and service providers out there, each vying for a share of
              a limited market. This makes it crucial that your business is
              competitive — that your business offers rates that reflect the
              need and demand of the market.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This does not mean cutting into your profits. Nor does it mean
              offering the cheapest rates possible — we’ll discuss this further
              below. Instead, it means providing great services at a competitive
              rate that enables you to grow your market share while securing
              full and fair remuneration for what you offer.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Build your reputation and identity as a driver</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Your clients don’t simply want the cheapest option out there. They
              need to know that they are working with a driver and a service
              provider they can really trust. They need to know that they can
              rely on you to deliver their cargo in the right way, safely, on
              time and in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Make this high level of quality part of your reputation and your
              identity. Build this identity into your rate negotiations so that
              it becomes clear to your clients precisely what kind of value you
              offer. As your reputation grows over time, these rate negotiation
              services will grow even more important, scaling alongside your
              business.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Expand the services you offer with consulting rates</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              On the surface, freight rate negotiations might seem relatively
              simple. You have a truck and an average rate per mile for you as
              the truck driver, or perhaps an hourly rate. You also have the
              type of cargo being transported, and any other concerns or
              considerations that may come along with this. These elements can
              be factored into your negotiations.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              But there is more to freight and logistics than this. Clients may
              require your expert insight into shipping and other aspects of
              logistics and may require your consultation. Consultation rate
              negotiations can provide an additional source of revenue for your
              business, as well as building your authority in the field.
            </p>
