              <h2>Hotshot Dispatch</h2>
              <br />
              <p>
                A lot of people outside the trucking industry have no idea what
                goes into getting their equipment, appliances, and materials to
                them. At Logity Dispatch, we know that hotshot drivers like you
                are really the “minutemen” of trucking, delivering loads to
                where they need to be on time. That’s why we offer top-notch
                hotshot dispatch services that can make all the difference when
                it comes to the bottom line for your hotshot trucking business.

            <h2>Hotshot Dispatch Loads</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Hotshot trucking, as a business, has its overlays, fees, and
              expenses. But, at the heart of it, much of your profitability will
              depend significantly on your ability to negotiate your rates and
              find the most lucrative loads. The problem is, on top of
              everything else you are doing, needing to turn your mind and
              efforts to searching and negotiating may feel like a time sink you
              can’t afford. If you are a business that is starting up, you may
              not have the best bargaining power or know-how for this part of
              the work. In many cases, you will find that hiring dispatch
              services for hotshot trucking is in your best interest.

            <h2>Handling Hotshot Dispatch</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Logity’s approach to hotshot truck dispatching is simple: We are
              here to help our clients get more money . We do this by searching
              for prospective hotshot loads on different platforms – some of
              which may not be accessible or recognized by people trying to
              arrange loads for themselves. Then, we try to negotiate the
              highest price so that loads are more profitable. Since time is
              money, we also help by saving clients the time and aggravation of
              navigating this area of the business so they can concentrate on
              doing what they do best: delivering the goods. Through our hotshot
              dispatch, we also deal with all the paperwork and more through our
              comprehensive trucking document management services.

            <h2>A Cost-Effective Dispatch Service for Hotshot Truckers</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              For small and medium hotshot trucking companies, we can provide
              significant cost savings. As an alternative to hiring in-house,
              full-time dispatchers, we are actually cheaper in many cases –
              even less than it would cost for one in-house dispatcher. Your
              company does not have to make expenditures for office rental or
              dedicate time and effort to proper employee recruitment. Coupled
              with our industry expertise and access to valuable search
              resources for hotshot dispatch loads, this makes Logity a
              fantastic option for hotshot trucking businesses who want to see a
              better bottom line.

            <h2>Logity and Other Hotshot Dispatch Companies</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              We have been providing high-quality dispatch services all over the
              trucking sector and throughout the United States since 2015. In
              that time, we have had many heart-to-hearts with our clients. What
              we discovered was that the biggest fears clients had about hiring
              a dispatch service for hotshot rather than handling everything
              themselves were the following:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                <strong>Forced dispatch</strong> – This is when a trucker has no
                right to reject loads and is obligated to accept whatever load
                is offered to them. At Logity Dispatch, we don’t want anyone to
                feel trapped this way, so we don’t lock clients in like that.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                <strong>Wasted time and money for little to no benefit</strong>
                – For small and medium businesses, especially those starting
                out, it’s a double-edged sword. Not only are they concerned
                about the dispatch service not being beneficial, but also that
                they will have expended time and money they could have dedicated
                to other parts of the business. Logity’s industry expertise,
                know-how, and dedication to clients mean that we will work hard
                to get you more money.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                <strong>Puffed up expectations</strong> – Sometimes, companies
                will talk up what they can do and what they can get for clients
                in order to make themselves more attractive to business owners.
                Many hotshot truckers have had unreasonably high expectations,
                only to suffer disappointment (or worse, turn down otherwise
                profitable loads offered to them) when their business doesn’t
                skyrocket the way they may have been led to believe. At Logity
                Dispatch, we don’t believe in sugarcoating. We give our clients
                the straight goods so they can make informed decisions based on
                reality.
              </li>
            </ul>
