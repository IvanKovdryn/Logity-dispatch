            <h2>Benefits of Power Only Trucking Services</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Power only trucking services involve the use of an independent
              driver or carrier tractor in the transport of a trailer. It is a
              cost-effective way for brokers to efficiently secure end-to-end
              logistics for loads. Other benefits of using our power only
              dispatch service include:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                <strong>Efficiency.</strong> Shippers can focus on their cargo
                while we handle the recruitment of top-notch drivers to haul
                their loads. There is no need to maintain a fleet of tractors or
                a roster packed with drivers on payroll with our team working in
                your corner.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                <strong>Speed and flexibility.</strong> Power only trucking
                provides the freedom to choose the right carrier for the job.
                Shippers are no longer limited by the number of tractor-trailers
                they own or how many drivers are available to accommodate loads.
                We help you maintain flexibility while quickly dispatching your
                cargo.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                <strong>Improved cash flow.</strong> Keeping drivers on staff is
                a costly line item in any shipper’s annual budget. Shippers can
                improve their cash flow by relying on power only trucking
                companies and dispatch services to fulfill their shipping needs.
                Greater budgeting flexibility and the ability to adjust
                processes as needed can free up much-needed cash for other
                capital expenses.

                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                <strong>Satisfied drivers.</strong> When shippers have their own
                drivers on payroll, there is the potential for downtime. This
                can create driver dissatisfaction and make it difficult to scale
                business operations up or down as needed. Independent drivers
                who choose to work with businesses that provide power only
                trucking services have greater job security.

            <h2>Power Only Dispatch – Help Finding Loads</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Independent truck drivers never have to sit idle again. Our
              dispatchers match drivers with suitable shippers in need of their
              power only trucking services. We match drivers to shippers with
              pricing expectations in alignment. Drivers retain the right to
              decline loads and to choose which routes they wish to be routed to
              or through. Logity Dispatch’s team works hard so you can do what
              you do best – drive.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Negotiating with Customers</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              No one likes to haggle. Sometimes it is necessary to ensure
              owner-operators of power only trucks get the best load rates.
              Better load rates equal more money in drivers’ pockets and a boost
              to their bottom lines. Our team closely monitors spot rates and
              fully understands the loads-to-trucks ratio, and uses this
              knowledge to negotiate the best load rates for drivers. We will
              always go above and beyond to reach a deal on transporting loads
              that require power only trucking services.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Power Only Trucking Billing Assistance</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              One of the only things more time-consuming than finding your own
              loads is billing for your services. Owner-operators never have to
              deal with invoicing when they work with Logity Dispatch to manage
              their power only trucking. It is our mission to make your job
              easier, matching power only owner-operators and shippers and then
              following up post-delivery with billing assistance.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Document Management and Paperwork</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              No one likes paperwork or managing the endless documents needed
              for successfully shipping loads. Whether you are a shipper or an
              owner-operator, Logity Dispatch can handle the unpleasantness that
              is all things paperwork on your behalf. From fuel receipts and
              detention pay to lumper receipts and credit checking brokers and
              shippers, we handle all documents and paperwork so you can place
              your focus where it matters most.
            </p>
