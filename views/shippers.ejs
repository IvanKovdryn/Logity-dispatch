            <h2>Dispatch Solutions for Shippers and Brokers</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Logity Dispatch is known for its excellent freight dispatch
              service. Our team has provided dispatching services for
              owner-operators and trucking fleets since 2015. We help find their
              loads, communicate with their customers, and complete all
              necessary paperwork so they can focus on the important task of
              transporting goods.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              When you choose Logity Dispatch as your freight dispatch service,
              you enjoy clear pricing devoid of hidden payments and termination
              fees. You can rest assured that the price we quote you is the
              price you pay.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Our team believes it takes both freight brokers and shippers to
              successfully transport loads. We can help make the process
              smoother for both parties. Hereâ€™s how.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>How we can help freight brokers and shippers</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              One of the biggest advantages we provide freight brokers and
              shippers is our extensive pool of independent owner-operators
              eager to assist with their loads. Our drivers have all cleared our
              approval process and are ready to service your needs. Other ways
              Logity Dispatch can help include:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                <strong>Eliminate double brokering</strong>. Double brokering is
                illegal unless the shipper consents to the arrangement. However,
                that does not stop some companies from engaging in the practice
                without the knowledge of the clients they represent. As
                independent dispatchers, we never double broker your loads. We
                work solely as independent dispatchers for drivers with whom we
                can provide all documentation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                <strong>Offer transparency</strong>. From our pricing model to
                updates about the progress of your load, we offer full
                transparency to freight brokers and carriers. Dispatchers keep
                track of preferred carriers and routes to ensure a smoother
                process each time you use our services.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="icon-check icon-check-expect"></span>
                <strong>Provide 24/7 updates</strong>. Our team never leaves
                freight brokers hanging. We provide timely updates on your loads
                during every leg of the journey. Potential delays or problems
                are communicated immediately. We are available 24/7 to track
                loads, answer your questions and concerns, and ensure your
                shipments arrive as planned.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              Most freight brokers and shippers do not have the time required to
              locate a freight forwarder on their own. You can trust our team at
              Logity Dispatch with the most fragile cargo and the tightest
              deadlines. We find the best, most cost-efficient shipping
              solutions to meet your needs every time.
            </p>
